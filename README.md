# ProjectHub

Welcome to *ProjectHub* â€“ an online platform designed to find, share, and manage projects with ease. Whether you're interested in AI, ML, or any other domain, ProjectHub allows you to explore projects by category and contribute your own summaries.

## Features
- *Easy Browsing*: Explore projects categorized by specific interests, such as AI, ML, and more.

- *Focused Platform*: Unlike general platforms like GitHub, ProjectHub is exclusively tailored for our college community, ensuring relevance and focus.

## Why ProjectHub?
- *Organized Content*: Unlike GitHub, which may lack proper categorization, ProjectHub is designed with structured categories to help you find the projects you need.
- *Broad Accessibility*: While GitHub is open to everyone, it can become cluttered, making it difficult to focus on college-specific projects. ProjectHub offers a dedicated space for our 
                           community.
- *Community-Centric*: ProjectHub focuses exclusively on the needs of our college community, unlike broader platforms like GitHub.
